Welcome to TPS (Trivial Port Scanner)
-------------------------------------
This application performs a SYN scan on a range of ports at a target IP address that you specify.
The list of open ports found by the scan is reported. 

Prerequisites
-------------
1. Currently, TPS only supports Windows platforms. Linux support is anticipated later this summer.
2. TPS is a Python application. You will need Python 3 (or later) installed on your machine.  You can
download the latest version of Python for Windows at: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
3. TPS uses the Scapy library, so you must have Scapy installed on your machine. Scapy can 
be found at: https://scapy.net/download/

To run TPS
----------
Download tps.py onto your machine. From a command prompt, change directory to the directory containing
tps.py, and enter:

python tps.py

TPS will start. Follow the on screen prompts to execute SYN scans.

Things to know
--------------
TPS will scan one port, or a range of ports. When scanning a range, you will be prompted to enter the first
and last ports in the range. TPS will scan every port in the range, includeing the starting and ending port
numbers that you specify. For example, if you entered the start of the range as port number 100, and the end
of the reange as port number 103, ports 100, 101, 102, and 103 would be scanned.

Currently, TPS only scans one target IP address. Future versions may scan multiple addresses, and allow the
user to enter a domain name to scan (instead of having to enter an IPv4 address).
